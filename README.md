# Flight-Fare-Prediction
Predict the fare on airline tickets
## GENERAL INFORMATION
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to help airline companies to predict the price of a ticket based 
on all the information surrounding it. This will help the airline companies to boost their revenue 
which is their ultimate aim. The price is an important factor as nowadays price changes due to 
seat availability and demand.
### Scope
This Functional and Technical Requirements Document outlines the functional requirements of 
flight fare prediction. The project will determine which airplane has lowest ticket. The project 
will also include a graphical representation of different model.
### Project Overview
This is the flight fare prediction in which we will find out the price of a ticket. We will Start the 
data analysis, data wrangling, data preprocessing, then perform many machine learning 
algorithms to determine the accurate results.
## CURRENT SYSTEM SUMMARY
Nowadays the price changes abruptly. The price of a flight may change within an hour as 
according to Robert W. Mann “Today, airlines price tickets as much as the customer and market 
will bear,” so this project flight fare prediction will help companies to keep an eye on all the 
factors and keep prices that will maximize their revenue.
## Functional Requirement
The flight fare prediction is a technology-based solution for airline companies to determine their 
prices. Following are the functional requirement:
- Data cleaning
- Data Handling
- Features detection from data
- Machine Learning algorithm


## EQUIPMENT AND SOFTWARE
- Python (including libraries like Pandas, matplotlib etc.)
- Jupyter notebook
## Data source
In this project I will use the dataset of MachineHack that is given on Kaggle. The dataset link is 
given below:
